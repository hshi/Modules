This is the cmake modules used for the c++ libraries, it contains the modules for different platform.
We need to set some environment variables, for example:

export FFTW='/opt/fftw'
export GMP='/opt/gmp'
export SPRNG='/home/boruoshihao/sprng/sprng2.0'
export MKL='/opt/intel/mkl'

Check your environment variables, some might already been defined, e.g. echo ${FFTW}
