This is the cmake modules used for the c++ libraries, it contains the modules for different platform.
We need to set some environment variables, for example:

export FFTW='/opt/fftw'
export GMP='/opt/gmp'
export SPRNG='/home/boruoshihao/sprng/sprng2.0'
export MKL='/opt/intel/mkl'
export ACML='/usr/local/acml-5.1.0/'
export MAGMA='/usr/local/intel64/nehalem/magma-1.3.0'
export LIBHAO='~/lib_hao/mpi'

Check your environment variables first, some might already been defined (e.g. you use "module load fftw" in a cluster, "echo ${FFTW}" will show that FFTW is defined).
